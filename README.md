Application of Convolutional Neural Networks for Geographic Identification in
Images from the Federal District

This study explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically
the ResNet50 architecture, adapted to identify locations in images from the Federal
District, covering both urban and rural areas. Utilizing 11,583 panoramic images from
Google Street View, the model was trained and evaluated on its ability to
geographically classify images. The results indicate that CNNs are effective in areas
with distinct visual features, but face challenges in rural regions due to visual
uniformity. This work highlights the applicability of CNNs in location identification and
the need for adjustments to improve accuracy in homogeneous environments.
